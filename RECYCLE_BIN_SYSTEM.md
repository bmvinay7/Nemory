# Recycle Bin System for AI Summaries

## Overview

The Recycle Bin system provides a safety net for accidentally deleted AI summaries, allowing users to restore them within 30 days before permanent deletion.

## Features

### 🗑️ **Soft Delete (Move to Recycle Bin)**
- When users delete a summary, it's moved to the recycle bin instead of being permanently deleted
- Summary is marked with `isDeleted: true`, `deletedAt: timestamp`, and `deletedBy: userId`
- Original summary data is preserved for potential restoration

### ♻️ **30-Day Retention Period**
- Deleted summaries are kept for exactly 30 days
- Users can restore summaries at any time within this period
- After 30 days, summaries are automatically and permanently deleted

### 🔄 **Restore Functionality**
- Users can restore summaries from the recycle bin with one click
- Restored summaries return to the main history with all original data intact
- Restoration removes deletion markers and adds the summary back to active lists

### 🚨 **Permanent Deletion**
- Users can manually permanently delete summaries from the recycle bin
- Automatic cleanup removes expired summaries (>30 days) permanently
- Permanent deletion cannot be undone

## User Interface

### **New Recycle Bin Tab**
- Added as the 4th tab in the AI Summarization interface
- Shows count badge when deleted summaries exist
- Clear visual distinction with red background for deleted items

### **Enhanced Delete Experience**
- Delete button now shows "Move to recycle bin" confirmation
- Toast notification explains 30-day restoration period
- Clear messaging about restoration options

### **Recycle Bin Features**
- **View**: Preview deleted summaries without restoring
- **Restore**: One-click restoration with confirmation
- **Permanent Delete**: Final deletion with strong warning
- **Days Remaining**: Clear countdown to permanent deletion
- **Expiration Warning**: Special alert when <7 days remain

## Technical Implementation

### **Data Structure Changes**
```typescript
interface SummaryResult {
  // ... existing fields
  isDeleted?: boolean;      // Marks summary as deleted
  deletedAt?: string;       // ISO timestamp of deletion
  deletedBy?: string;       // User ID who deleted it
}
```

### **Storage Service Methods**
```typescript
// Soft delete (move to recycle bin)
deleteSummary(summaryId: string, userId: string): Promise<void>

// Get deleted summaries
getDeletedSummaries(userId: string): Promise<SummaryResult[]>

// Restore from recycle bin
restoreSummary(summaryId: string, userId: string): Promise<void>

// Permanent deletion
permanentlyDeleteSummary(summaryId: string, userId: string): Promise<void>

// Automatic cleanup
cleanupExpiredSummaries(userId: string): Promise<number>

// Utility methods
isWithinRecycleBinPeriod(deletedAt: string): boolean
getDaysUntilPermanentDeletion(deletedAt: string): number
```

### **Database Queries**
```typescript
// Active summaries (excludes deleted)
where('userId', '==', userId)
where('isDeleted', '!=', true)

// Deleted summaries (recycle bin)
where('userId', '==', userId)
where('isDeleted', '==', true)
```

### **Automatic Cleanup**
- Runs when user loads the AI Summarization interface
- Silently removes expired summaries (>30 days)
- Updates recycle bin display after cleanup
- Logs cleanup activity for monitoring

## User Experience Flow
